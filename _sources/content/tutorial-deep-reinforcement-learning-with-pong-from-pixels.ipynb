    "# Deep reinforcement learning with Pong from pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to implement a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent from scratch using a policy gradient method that learns to play the [Pong](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pong-v0/) video game using screen pixels as inputs with NumPy. Your Pong agent will obtain experience on the go using an [artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) as its [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pong is a 2D game from 1972 where two players use \"rackets\" to play a form of table tennis. Each player moves the racket up and down the screen and tries to hit a ball in their opponent's direction by touching it. The goal is to hit the ball such that it goes past the opponent's racket (they miss their shot). According to the rules, if a player reaches 21 points, they win. In Pong, the RL agent that learns to play against an opponent is displayed on the right.\n",

    "This example is based on the [code](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/a4166c7fe253700972fcbc77e4ea32c5) developed by [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai) for the [Deep RL Bootcamp](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/home) in 2017 at UC Berkeley. His [blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) from 2016 also provides more background on the mechanics and theory used in Pong RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenAI Gym**: To help with the game environment, you will use [Gym](https://gym.openai.com) — an open-source Python interface [developed by OpenAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540) that helps perform RL tasks while supporting many simulation environments.\n",
    "- **Python and NumPy**: The reader should have some knowledge of Python, NumPy array manipulation, and linear algebra.\n",
    "- **Deep learning and deep RL**: You should be familiar with main concepts of [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), which are explained in the [Deep learning](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf) paper published in 2015 by Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton, who are regarded as some of the pioneers of the field. The tutorial will try to guide you through the main concepts of deep RL and you will find various literature with links to original sources for your convenience.\n",
    "- **Jupyter notebook environments**: Because RL experiments can require high computing power, you can run the tutorial on the cloud for free using [Binder](https://mybinder.org) or [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) (which offers free limited GPU and TPU acceleration).\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**: For plotting images. Check out the [installation](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/users/installing.html) guide to set it up in your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial can also be run locally in an isolated environment, such as [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/).\n",

    "### A note on RL and deep RL\n",
    "\n",
    "In [_RL_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning), your agent learns from trial and error by interacting with an environment using a so-called policy to gain experience. After taking one action, the agent receives information about its reward (which it may or may not get) and the next observation of the environment. It can then proceed to take another action. This happens over a number of episodes and/or until the task is deemed to be complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent's policy works by \"mapping\" the agent's observations to its actions — that is, assigning a presentation of what the agent observes with required actions. The overall goal is usually to optimize the agent's policy such that it maximizes the expected rewards from each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed information about RL, there is an [introductory book](https://web.archive.org/web/20050806080008/http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book.html) by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barton.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the Appendix at the end of the tutorial for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep RL glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a concise glossary of deep RL terms you may find useful for the remaining part of the tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a finite-horizon world, such as a game of Pong, the learning agent can explore (and exploit) the _environment_ over an _episode_. It usually takes many episodes for the agent to learn.\n",
    "- The agent interacts with the _environment_ using _actions_.\n",
    "- After taking an action, the agent receives some feedback through a _reward_ (if there is one), depending on which action it takes and the _state_ it is in. The state contains information about the environment.\n",
    "- The agent's _observation_ is a partial observation of the state — this is the term this tutorial prefers (instead of _state_).\n",
    "- The agent can choose an action based on cumulative _rewards_ (also known as the _value function_) and the _policy_. The _cumulative reward function_ estimates the quality of the observations the agent visits using its _policy_.\n",
    "- The _policy_ (defined by a neural network) outputs action choices (as (log) probabilities) that should maximize the cumulative rewards from the state the agent is in.\n",
    "- The _expected return from an observation_, conditional to the action, is called the _action-value_ function. To provide more weight to shorter-term rewards versus the longer-term ones, you usually use a _discount factor_ (often a floating point number between 0.9 and 0.99).\n",
    "- The sequence of actions and states (observations) during each policy \"run\" by the agent is sometimes referred to as a _trajectory_ — such a sequence yields _rewards_.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will train your Pong agent through an \"on-policy\" method using policy gradients — it's an algorithm belonging to a family of _policy-based_ methods. Policy gradient methods typically update the parameters of the policy with respect to the long-term cumulative reward using [_gradient descent_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) that is widely used in machine learning. And, since the goal is to maximize the function (the rewards), not minimize it, the process is also called _gradient ascent_. In other words, you use a policy for the agent to take actions and the objective is to maximize the rewards, which you do by computing the gradients and use them to update the parameters in the policy (neural) network.\n",

    "- In Pong, if a player doesn't hit the ball back, they receive a negative reward (-1) and the other player gets a +1 reward. The rewards that the agent receives by playing Pong have a significant variance. Therefore, it's best practice to normalize them with the same mean (using [`np.mean()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html)) and standard deviation (using NumPy's [`np.std()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.std.html?highlight=std)).\n",

    "- When using only NumPy, the deep RL training process, including backpropagation, spans several lines of code that may appear quite long. One of the main reasons for this is you're not using a deep learning framework with an automatic differentiation library that usually simplifies such experiments. This tutorial shows how to perform everything from scratch but you can also use one of many Python-based frameworks with \"autodiff\" and \"autograd\", which you will learn about at the end of the tutorial.\n",

    "\n",
    "Policy gradient methods can learn a task if you give them a lot of time, and optimization in RL is a challenging problem. Training agents to learn to play Pong or any other task can be sample-inefficient and require a lot of episodes. You may also notice in your training output that even after hundreds of episodes, the rewards may have high variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, like in many deep learning-based algorithms, you should take into account a large amount of parameters that your policy has to learn. In Pong, this number adds up to 1 million or more with 200 nodes in the hidden layer of the network and the input dimension being of size 6,400 (80x80). Therefore, adding more CPUs and GPUs to assist with training can always be an option.\n",

    "- _Deep RL_ combines RL with [deep learning](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf). The field had its first major success in more complex environments, such as video games, in 2013 — a year after the [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) breakthrough in computer vision. Volodymyr Mnih and colleagues at DeepMind published a research paper called [Playing Atari with deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) (and [updated](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf) in 2015) that showed that they were able to train an agent that could play several classic games from the Arcade Learning Environment at a human-level. Their RL algorithm — called a deep Q-network (DQN) — used [convolutional layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) in a neural network that approximated [Q learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) and used [experience replay](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf).\n",

    "- Policy gradients _with function approximation_, such as neural networks, were [written about](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1713-policy-gradient-methods-for-reinforcement-learning-with-function-approximation.pdf) in 2000 by Richard Sutton et al. They were influenced by a number of previous works, including statistical gradient-following algorithms, such as [REINFORCE](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Simple-statistical-gradient-following-algorithms-Williams/4c915c1eecb217c123a36dc6d3ce52d12c742614) (Ronald Williams, 1992), as well as [backpropagation](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/naturebp.pdf) (Geoffrey Hinton, 1986), which helps deep learning algorithms learn. RL with neural-network function approximation were introduced in the 1990s in research by Gerald Tesauro ([Temporal difference learning and td-gammon](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/203330.203343), 1995), who worked with IBM on an agent that learned to [play backgammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD-Gammon) in 1992, and Long-Ji Lin ([Reinforcement learning for robots using neural networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/168871), 1993).\n",

    "- One of the reasons why video games are popular in deep RL research is that, unlike real-world experiments, such as RL with [remote-controlled helicopters](http://heli.stanford.edu/papers/nips06-aerobatichelicopter.pdf) ([Pieter Abbeel](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/abbeel.html)  et al, 2006), virtual simulations can offer safer testing environments.\n",

    "- If you're interested in learning about the implications of deep RL on other fields, such as neuroscience, you can refer to a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03750.pdf) by [Matthew Botvinick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0LddBiF5jM) et al (2020).\n",

    "### How to set up video playback in your Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you're using [**Binder**](https://mybinder.org) — a free Jupyter notebook-based tool — you can set up the Docker image and add `freeglut3-dev`, `xvfb`, and `x11-utils` to the `apt.txt` configuration file to install the initial dependencies. Then, to `binder/environment.yml` under `channels`, add `gym`, `pyvirtualdisplay` and anything else you may need, such as `python=3.7`, `pip`, and `jupyterlab`. Check the following [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/rendering-openai-gym-envs-on-binder-and-google-colab-536f99391cc7) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you're using [**Google Colaboratory**](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) (another free Jupyter notebook-based tool), you can enable video playback of the game environments installing and setting up [X virtual frame buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb)/[Xvfb](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml), [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System), [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org), [PyVirtualDisplay](https://github.com/ponty/PyVirtualDisplay), [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net), and other dependencies, as described further below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you're using Google Colaboratory, run the following commands in the notebook cells to help with video playback:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    # Install Xvfb and X11 dependencies.\n",
    "    !apt-get install -y xvfb x11-utils > /dev/null 2>&1\n",
    "    # To work with videos, install FFmpeg.\n",
    "    !apt-get install -y ffmpeg > /dev/null 2>&1\n",
    "    # Install PyVirtualDisplay for visual feedback and other libraries/dependencies.\n",
    "    !pip install pyvirtualdisplay PyOpenGL PyOpenGL-accelerate > /dev/null 2>&1\n",

Then, you can run your Gym experiment through `python your-code.py` in your terminal. To enable rendering, you can use the command-line interface by following the [official OpenAI Gym documentation](https://github.com/openai/gym#rendering-on-a-server) (make sure you have Gym and Xvfb installed, as described in the guide)."
